# Advent of Code

> My solutions of [*Advent of Code*](http://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in javascript.

I am not in the right time... I found this piece of gem a few months ago so I decided to solve all the puzzles in my spare time.

### How to check:
Note: requires node.js and npm to be able to use this properly.
      I am using the latest ones, of course.
```
// Get the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/knightburton/advent-of-code.git

// Change dir
$ cd advent-of-code

// Install the dependencies
$ npm install

// Select a year and a day to run the scripts
$ npm run start:<year> <day>

// Example: npm run start:2017 4
```

Note: If you want to change the input puzzle of a day just change the content of the `input.txt` in the correct directory.
